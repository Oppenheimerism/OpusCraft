## M1: signs and hanging signs

Oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry, bamboo, crimson and warped: a standing sign (16
rotations), a wall sign, a hanging sign (straight chains, or a vee of chains when `attached`, 16 rotations) and a wall
hanging sign for each, all waterloggable: 44 blocks, 22 items.

- **Blocks** (`src/world/blocksSigns.ts`): vanilla's properties, shapes (standing 4..12 column; wall 4.5..12.5 against
  the wall; hanging 14×10 board square to the world or the 10×16 square when turned between; wall hanging bracket
  plus board, the bracket being the only collision), hardness 1, axe, map colour of the planks, lava lights the
  overworld woods' (vanilla `ignitedByLava`), not the nether ones'. Sounds: signs sound as their wood (`wood`,
  `cherry_wood`, `bamboo_wood`, `nether_wood`); hanging signs have vanilla's four hanging-sign sound types
  (`hanging_sign`, `nether_wood_hanging_sign`, `bamboo_wood_hanging_sign`, `cherry_wood_hanging_sign`).
- **Placing** (`src/game/signs.ts`, vanilla `StandingAndWallBlockItem`/`SignItem`/`HangingSignItem`): tried in the
  order the player looks; standing on anything legacy-solid (signs and banners count, vanilla `forceSolidOn`), on a
  wall's solid face, under a block whose underside's centre is sturdy (a bottom slab yes, a top slab no), under a
  fence or a hanging sign; sneaking or a partial underside gives the vee (`attached`), turned to any of 16; a hanging
  sign held to another's underside chains under it square and straight on; a wall hanging sign goes across the face
  clicked and needs something to hang from along its bracket (a sturdy face or another wall hanging sign on the same
  axis). Standing, wall and ceiling signs break when their support goes; a wall hanging sign stays (as in vanilla).
- **Editor** (`src/gui/screens/signEdit.ts`, vanilla `SignEditScreen`/`HangingSignEditScreen`): opens on placing
  (front) and on right-click (the side the player is on: vanilla `isFacingFrontText`), 4 lines no wider than 90 px
  (60 px on a hanging sign), cursor blink, selection, Ctrl+A/C/V/X, Home/End, arrows, Up/Down/Enter between lines, Done;
  the sign drawn big behind the text at vanilla's scales (a standing sign's board and stick, a wall sign's board 35 px
  lower, a hanging sign's 16×16 picture at 4.5×). While typing, the sign in the world shows what is typed (in this game
  only). It closes when the sign goes or the player walks out of reach.
- **Writing** (vanilla `ServerGamePacketListenerImpl.handleSignUpdate` → `SignBlockEntity.updateSignText`): taken only
  from the player the sign is open for, within reach + 4 blocks, not waxed, exactly 4 lines of at most 384 characters;
  formatting codes (`§x`) and control characters are stripped. Nobody else can open a sign while it is being edited.
- **Dyes, ink, wax** (vanilla `SignApplicator`): any of the 16 dyes colours the side the player is on (only if it has
  text), glow ink sac makes it glow, ink sac undoes the glow, honeycomb waxes the sign (with the wax particles and
  sound; a waxed sign can't be edited or dyed and knocks with `block.sign.waxed_interact_fail`). The item is used up
  except in creative; each fires the `block_change` game event. **Glow and Behold!** (`husbandry/make_a_sign_glow`)
  is now earned (it was `never`).
- **Rendering** (`src/render/signRenderer.ts`, vanilla `SignRenderer`/`HangingSignRenderer`): the models at vanilla's
  sizes and transforms with procedural 64×32 textures per wood; text in the game font at vanilla's scale and offsets
  (lines 10 apart and 90 wide on a sign, 9 and 60 on a hanging sign; a line too wide is cut as `Font.split` cuts it);
  dark text colour = 0.4 × the dye's; glowing text full-bright with the 8-way outline within 16 blocks (always for
  black, whose outline is cream `0xF0EBCC`); both sides drawn; within the block-entity view distance (64).
- **Items, recipes, creative**: stack of 16; 6 planks + stick → 3 signs; 2 chains + 6 stripped logs/stems → 6 hanging
  signs (the bamboo ones have no recipe here because bamboo planks and the stripped bamboo block don't exist yet; they
  are still in the creative tab and in loot); fuel 200 / 800 ticks (none for crimson and warped); recipe-book groups
  `wooden_sign` / `hanging_sign`; all 22 in the Functional Blocks tab in vanilla's order where the oak sign was.
- **Saving**: the chunk's block entities, as vanilla's NBT keys (`front_text`/`back_text` as
  `{"messages","color","has_glowing_text"}` and `is_waxed`); a damaged save is cleaned up on load (lines cleaned, cut to
  384, padded to 4; unknown colour → black).
- **Multiplayer**: guests see signs and text (they come with the chunk, and every change is sent as block-entity data);
  a guest who places or clicks a sign gets its editor on its own screen (the host sends the block, its text, then
  `CB.OpenSignEditor`, as vanilla's `ServerPlayer.openTextEdit` does); the guest's Done sends `SB.SignUpdate`, which the
  host checks as above before writing and broadcasting. Malformed packets (a line over 384, wrong field count or
  types, out-of-world positions) disconnect the guest with a reason.

**New files**: `src/world/blocksSigns.ts`, `src/world/signBlockEntity.ts`, `src/game/signs.ts`,
`src/gui/screens/signEdit.ts`, `src/render/signRenderer.ts`, `src/textures/signs.ts`, `src/item/itemsSigns.ts`,
`src/inventory/recipesSigns.ts`, `src/audio/gen/signs.ts`; tests `tests/survival-blocks/signs.mjs`,
`tests/survival-blocks/signs-mp.mjs`.

**Shared files touched** (each a registration line or a few lines, marked `(signs)`):
`src/world/blocks.ts` (`registerSignBlocks()`), `src/item/item.ts` (`registerSignItems`), `src/textures/blocks.ts`
(bamboo planks/stripped block textures if missing), `src/textures/items.ts` (hanging sign icons),
`src/inventory/recipes.ts` (`registerSignRecipes`), `src/inventory/recipeBook.ts` (`hanging_sign` group before
`wooden_sign`), `src/gui/screens/creative.ts` (tab order), `src/audio/synth.ts` (`signSounds`), `src/game/level.ts`
(`import './signs'`), `src/game/banners.ts` (`legacySolid` also true for signs), `src/game/shapeUpdates.ts` (wall
posts: hanging signs aren't in `#wall_post_override`), `src/game/advancements.ts` (Glow and Behold! criterion),
`src/render/entityRenderer.ts` (`DrawState.polygonOffset`, vanilla's text layering), `src/render/entityRenderers.ts`
(calls `SignRenderer`), `src/gui/screens/index.ts` (`installSignScreens`), `src/gui/screens/book.ts` (exports its text
field helpers), `src/net/protocol.ts` (`SB.SignUpdate = 40`, `CB.OpenSignEditor = 80` with validators),
`src/net/config.ts` (`PROTOCOL_VERSION` 6 → 7, the branch's one bump), `src/net/server/session.ts`,
`src/net/server/hostServer.ts` (`openSignEditor`), `src/net/client/clientSession.ts` (`signUpdate`).

**Hooks**: `setSignEditorHook(f)` (game/signs.ts; the GUI installs it, routing a guest's player's editor to
`HostServer.openSignEditor`), `setSignPreview` / `signTextShown` (editor preview), `setSignScopingHook(f)`
(render/signRenderer.ts; the spyglass makes glow outlines visible at any distance: wired in M4).

**Deviations and open points**
- Bamboo signs and hanging signs have no crafting recipe: bamboo planks and the stripped bamboo block aren't in the
  game yet. Their particle textures are drawn only if nothing else registers them.
- The update's distance check is applied to every kind of sign (vanilla's `playerIsTooFarToEdit` covers the same).
- Clicking a sign never runs commands (no click events in this game's text).
- The line cut uses the game font's advances (vanilla `StringSplitter`); formatting isn't supported, so lines are
  plain text.
- The hanging signs' sounds are generated as the wood's sound mixed with a chain's rattle (vanilla has its own
  recordings).
- The pre-existing thin orange seam lines visible in some screenshots of the test stage appear without any sign too
  (a renderer artefact unrelated to this work).

**Tests**: `tests/survival-blocks/signs.mjs` (120 checks: blocks, items, recipes, placing, survival, writing and its
refusals, sides, dyes/glow/ink/wax, the advancement, save/load, text layout, the editor's keys) and
`tests/survival-blocks/signs-mp.mjs` (59 checks: guest places → its editor opens on its screen → host validates and
broadcasts; another guest can't write meanwhile; dyes/glow/ink/wax from a guest; back side; too far; hanging sign; the
host's own player editing; a late joiner sees text; malformed packets). Existing suites re-run after the change:
`tests/menus/banners.mjs`, `tests/multiplayer/m1-login.mjs`, `m1-security.mjs`, `m1-transport.mjs`, `m1-blocks.mjs`,
`m2-actions.mjs`: all pass. `npm run typecheck` clean.

**Try it** (`npm run dev`, then http://localhost:5173/?seed=12345):
1. Creative: the Functional Blocks tab lists every wood's sign and hanging sign after the tinted glass.
2. Place an oak sign on the ground: the editor opens; type 4 lines (try a too-long line, arrows, Ctrl+A), Done. The
   text faces you. Walk round: the back is blank; right-click from behind edits the back.
3. Put one on a wall, on another sign, under a block (straight chains), under a fence or while sneaking (vee of
   chains), on the side of a block (wall hanging sign), under a hanging sign (it chains). Break the block under/behind
   each: they drop, except the wall hanging sign.
4. Right-click written text with red dye, a glow ink sac (glows, outlined), an ink sac (stops), honeycomb (wax
   particles; now clicking only knocks). Get "Glow and Behold!".
5. In a world made from the title screen (the `?seed=` quick-start world is never saved): save and quit, reopen:
   text, colours, glow and wax are still there.
6. LAN: open to LAN, join from a second tab (`?join=<code>` or `?mp=join`). The guest places a sign: the editor opens
   on the guest's screen; after Done the host sees the text. While one edits, the other's click does nothing. A guest
   who joins later sees all the signs' text.
